Barbara Ramsay of Artex, Clyfford Still Museum Director Dean Sobel, and Chief Conservator James Squires discuss the discoveries that resulted from the lengthy reporting process and the instances of minimal intervention that followed. Continuing this process until its opening in 2011 and thereafter, the Clyfford Still Museum successfully exhibited more than 500 works by the artist in ten original exhibitions and other regular rotations in its first three years. As of the fall of 2014, more than 2,500 works by the artist remain yet to be displayed.",

Clyfford Still taught painting at Washington State College (now Washington State University), where he earned his own Master of Arts in Fine Arts degree in 1935; the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute), where he met fellow faculty member Mark Rothko in 1943; and the School of Art at the Richmond Professional Institute of the College of William & Mary (now Virginia Commonwealth University). He was also a guest instructor at the University of Colorado at Boulder during the summer of 1960, and in 1937 co-founded the Nespelem Art Colony, a small artists’ residency that produced hundreds of portraits and landscapes depicting life on the Colville Indian Reservation over the course of four summers.",

The Clyfford Still Museum Archives currently hold more than 30 hours of audio recordings captured from seven reel-to-reel and 20 cassette tapes from as early as 1949. Airshow Restoration Center, a nationally recognized audio preservation lab in Boulder, Colorado, worked with the Museum on converting the original recordings to digital audio files.",

The exhibition examines both his and Still’s unique relationship to black in their paintings, whether it’s used to force viewers out of their comfort zones, evoke emotions, or confront conventional notions of race. Bradford reads Still’s relationship with black as an open-ended invitation for dialogue. Bradford says, \"For me as an artist, I am much more interested in questions than answers. 'Shade' is simply putting questions into the public domain.\"",
